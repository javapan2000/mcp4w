**Subject: Celebrating Your 11-Year Milestone—Thank You for Leading the Way**

Dear **Naga**,

Congratulations on reaching an outstanding **11 years** with our team! As I reflect on the journey we have shared, I’m reminded again and again of how much your passion, expertise, and “can-do” spirit have shaped who we are as a company.

Over the past decade you have:

* **Pioneered first-of-their-kind services.** From taking the very first *BXP container service* live in production to championing our *first GF application*, you repeatedly opened new frontiers for us—and did it with confidence and rigor.
* **Modernized our technology stack.** Your leadership in the transition to **Angular and Spring Boot** set a new bar for engineering excellence, simplified future development, and empowered teams across the organization.
* **Stood shoulder-to-shoulder in moments of need.** When critical issues surfaced, you volunteered without hesitation, working day and night until every incident was resolved—an inspiring demonstration of ownership and resilience.
* **Gone the extra mile with innovation.** The **Accelerator project**, which you nurtured from idea to execution and ultimately to finalist status several times, is proof of your creativity and relentless pursuit of better ways to serve our customers.

Through it all, you have embodied the values we prize most—*staying curious, sparking progress, owning outcomes, and helping us all thrive together*. Your example has become a template for how great teammates lift the organization: you see challenges as invitations, you share knowledge freely, and you celebrate collective wins louder than individual ones. That outlook makes you a true **role model**.

As we embark on the next chapter with our **new cloud team**, I’m excited to continue learning from you and building on the foundation you helped create. I have every confidence that, together, we will deliver even greater impact in the years ahead.

Thank you, Naga, for 11 remarkable years of commitment and excellence. It is a privilege to work with you, and I look forward to all we will accomplish next—side by side.

Warm regards,

*\[Your Name]*
