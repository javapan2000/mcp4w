Here’s the quickest, *official* way to move an Azure API Management (APIM) instance into the **“AI Gateway Early (GenAI Release)”** update group so you can light-up previews such as MCP-server, semantic-caching, LLM policies, etc.

---

### 1. Check the prerequisites

| Requirement                                   | Why it matters                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SKU v1 tier** – Basic, Standard, or Premium | Update-groups aren’t exposed yet for Consumption or the new v2 tiers. ([techcommunity.microsoft.com][1])             |
| **Service Update Settings feature** (now GA)  | The blade where you pick an update-group only appears if you’re on a supported tier. ([learn.microsoft.com][2])      |
| **Non-production instance recommended**       | AI Gateway Early gets builds earlier than everyone else; they can be less stable. ([techcommunity.microsoft.com][3]) |

### 2. Opt-in via the Azure portal (two-minute job)

1. **Portal → your APIM instance**
2. Left menu → **Deployment + infrastructure ▸ Service update settings**
3. Click **Edit** (Update group) → choose **AI Gateway Early (GenAI release channel)**
4. **Save** 🡒 propagation typically finishes in ≈ 2 hours. ([learn.microsoft.com][2], [techcommunity.microsoft.com][4])

*Tip:* while you’re there, you can set an 8-hour **maintenance window** (defaults to 22:00-06:00 local) so updates land when traffic is quiet. ([learn.microsoft.com][2])

---

### 3. Verify it worked

* **Activity Log** – look for a *“Scheduled maintenance”* event once the new build deploys.
* **Portal banner** – the Service update settings blade will show “AI Gateway Early” as the current group.
* **MCP server UI** – append `?Microsoft_Azure_ApiManagement=mcp` to your portal URL; if the MCP wizard loads, the feature flag has lit up. ([techcommunity.microsoft.com][1])

---

### 4. (Optional) automate it

As of June 2025 the only documented path is the portal. A **preview ARM/Bicep** resource (`Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/serviceUpdateSettings@2024-04-01-preview`) exists but isn’t in Azure CLI yet; use at your own risk:

```bicep
resource update 'Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/serviceUpdateSettings@2024-04-01-preview' = {
  name: 'current'
  parent: apim
  properties: {
    updateGroup: 'AI_GATEWAY_EARLY'   // other values: EARLY, DEFAULT, LATE
    maintenanceWindow: {
      start: '22:00'
      end:   '06:00'
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 5. What happens next?

* **Feature access** – new GenAI Gateway features will surface in your portal & policies as soon as the next build rolls out (check the \[Azure Integration Services blog] for changelogs). ([techcommunity.microsoft.com][4])
* **Rollback path** – just switch back to **Default** (or **Late**) in the same blade; the service will drain back to the mainstream build at the next rollout.

That’s it—once the build finishes propagating you can start exposing your APIs as MCP tools, try semantic caching, content-safety policies, and the rest of the AI Gateway preview stack. Happy experimenting!
